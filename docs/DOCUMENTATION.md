# TORTOISE DOCUMENTATION

---
All documentation for a specific `function`/`macro`/`typedef`/`class`, etc, can be found above or beside the specific `function`/`macro`/`typedef`/`class` as a comment.

You can find these comments by either looking at the source code and searching for the specific `function`/`macro`/`typedef`/`class`, or if you are in an IDE (Such as Visual Studio Community), you should be able to see the comments by simply hovering over the specific `function`/`macro`/`typedef`/`class`.
