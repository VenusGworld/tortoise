# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

---
This guideline will cover how you can contribute to the project.
<br>

# Step 1: Choose the right branch
Make sure you choose the **dev** branch to make pull requests. 

# Step 2: Make changes
If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or even update the README, write code/text that looks like the already existing code/text. Don't clutter up the code or remove important comments. 

# Step 3: Create the pull request
After you submit your pull request, I will get back to you shortly and give you feedback or I will just merge your commits straight away.
